I recieved my Ph.D. degree from [Mechanical and Aerospace](https://mae.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California, Davis in 2021, under the mentoring of Prof. [Stavros G. Voukiougas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/). Before that, I received M.S degree in Naval and Ocean Engineering from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China (2015). I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [Bio-automation lab](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/research/lab-members/) from UC-Davis. My research interests includes:

* Management of Vehicle logistics in the agricultural field; 
* Precision agricultural solutions (IoT);
* Autonomous vehicle driving in the agricultural field;
* Human robot interaction in the agricultural domain;

**I am very personally open to research discussion and collobaration, please feel free to get in touch**

Finished projects:
======
1. Design and control of crop-transport robotic system for harvest-aiding;
2. Data-driven simulator of manual & robot-aiding strawberry harvesting;
3. **Online scheduling** algorithm processing stochastic and dynamic transport requests;
4. Integration and implementation of complex robotic system in the commercial strawberry field;
5. Design and implementation of crop-transport robots in the vineyard;

Ongoing Research Projects:
=========
1. Vision based orchard SLAM and navigation;
2. Post-harvesting yield estimation in the almond field;
3. Instrumented cart system for data collection in the strawberry field;
4. Human robot interaction in the agricultural application;
