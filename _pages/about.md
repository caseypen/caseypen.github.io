This homepage is academic road map of Chen Peng since 2017 in the [Bio-automation lab](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/research/lab-members/) from UC, Davis. His Ph.D. project is design, development and implementation of Co-robotic harvest-aiding system in the field of fragile fruit, like strawberries and table grapes. His research interests includes:
* **Modeling** of human and robot activities in the field operations;
* Optimized **online scheduling** of robotic vehicles;
* Implementation of **robotic field operation system** in the agricultural activities;

Ph.D. Research Project Topics:
======
1. Design and Control of Fragile cRop hArvest-aIding mobiLe robots **(FRAIL-Bots)**;
2. Data-driven simulator of manual & robot-aiding strawberry harvesting;
3. **Online scheduling** algorithm processing stochastic and dynamic transport requests;
4. Implementation of harves-aiding system in the commercial strawberry field;
5. Design of crop-transport robots in the vineyard;

Post-Doctoral Research Project Topics:
=========
1. Vision based orchard SLAM and navigation;
2. Post-harvesting yield estimation in the almond field;
3. Instrumented cart system for data collection in the strawberry field;
