I recieved my Ph.D. in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucdavis.edu/) from the University of California, Davis in 2021, under the mentorship of Prof. [Stavros G. Voukiougas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/). Following my doctorate, I served as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bio-automation lab](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/research/lab-members/) within the Department of [Biological and Agricultural Engineering](https://bae.ucdavis.edu/) from UC-Davis for one year. 

I then joined MU-ROBOTIX, a startup specializing in intelligent E-tractors, as a Research Scientist. Currently, I am a Principal Investigator at the Hangzhou Global Innovation and Technology Center of Zhejiang University([ZJU-HIC](https://hic.zju.edu.cn/2023/0904/c72951a2797324/page.htm)). 

My **MISSION** is to  integrate robotic technologies into agricultural operations to enhance efficiency and sustainability in farming practices. My research interests are as follows: 
- Motion Planning for Agricultural Vehicles
- Multi-Robot Planning & Coordination in Smart Agriculture
- Robust Control of Underwater Robots in Aquaculture
