<p>
  Wenwu Lu received his Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in 2024. His technical background spans the design, modeling and control of agricultural robotic picking arms, as well as autonomous navigation for agricultural robots. He is enthusiastic in leveraging advanced mechanical design and intelligent control algorithms to enhance agricultural operation efficiency and reduce reliance on manual labor.

  <!-- Currently, Wenwu Lu is dedicated to developing intelligent robotic systems for precision agriculture, with a particular focus on fruit and vegetable harvesting. In the lab, his primary research involves the development of a transportation system for strawberry-picking robots. He is working on multi-robot cooperative control technology to address challenges in transportation and scheduling during harvesting, aiming to optimize operational efficiency. His research not only explores real-time collaboration and communication in multi-robot systems but also includes high-precision motion control and navigation optimization in complex agricultural environments, driving the evolution of agricultural robots from single-task execution to multi-task coordination. -->
