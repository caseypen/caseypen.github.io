excerpt: 'This work presents the implementation and integration of the co-robotic harvest-aid system and its deployment during commercial strawberry harvesting. The evaluation experiments demonstrated that the proof-of-concept system was fully functional. The co-robots improved the mean harvesting efficiency by around 10% and reduced the mean non-productive time by 60%, when the robot-to-picker ratio was 1:3.'

Mechanizing the manual harvesting of fresh market fruits constitutes one of the biggest challenges to the sustainability of the fruit industry. During manual harvesting of some fresh-market crops like strawberries and table grapes, pickers spend significant amounts of time walking to carry full trays to a collection station at the edge of the field. A step toward increasing harvest automation for such crops is to deploy harvest-aid robots that transport the empty and full trays, thus increasing harvest efficiency by reducing pickersâ€™ non-productive walking times. This work presents the implementation and integration of the co-robotic harvest-aid system and its deployment during commercial strawberry harvesting. The evaluation experiments demonstrated that the proof-of-concept system was fully functional. The co-robots improved the mean harvesting efficiency by around 10% and reduced the mean non-productive time by 60%, when the robot-to-picker ratio was 1:3. The concepts developed in this work can be applied to robotic harvest-aids for other manually harvested crops that involve a substantial human-powered produce transport, as well as to in-field harvesting logistics for highly mechanized field crops that involve coordination of harvesters and autonomous transport trucks.
