An emerging trend in agricultural field operations is the deployment of supervised autonomous
teams of cooperating agricultural self-propelled machines. During such operations several
machines (Agricultural Primary Units - APUs) perform the main field task (e.g., spraying,
harvesting), and other machines (Field Service Units - FSUs) provide in-field logistics support,
i.e., they transport working materials (chemicals, crop) between APUs and other units stationed
outside the field. The same concept is being researched for robot-aided harvesting of specialty
crops. For example, in strawberry harvesting, each picker (APU) harvests and fills up a tray; a
mobile robot (FSU) travels to the picker and when their tray is full, it transports it to a field
unloading station. Reactive scheduling policies for FSUs (go to a picker when tray becomes full)
are not efficient, because FSUs may have to traverse large distances to reach pickers, thus
introducing large waiting times.<br/><img src='/images/ASABE_2019.png'>"
