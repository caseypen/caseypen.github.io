With the rapid development of robotics technology in orchard operations, the demand for intelligent and safe navigation of robots is increasingly becoming a necessity. Unlike open-field environments, orchard land use is more conservative, especially reflected in the narrow and irregular characteristics of the headland space. Also, the high value of orchard plants means significant losses in the event of robot collisions. Traditional agricultural vehicle path planning algorithms often fail to meet the safety operation requirements in orchard headland, and the optimization-based path planning algorithm proposed by the author cannot meet the requirements for online solving. Surrounding the above problems, this project proposes an online trajectory planning algorithm for agricultural robots based on convex optimization, to enhance the adaptability of robots to unstructured orchard environments and ensure the safety of operations.
