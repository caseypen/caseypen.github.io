## Learning outcomes of the course 
1. Model and analyze dynamic systems,
2. Define objectives for the performance of dynamic systems,
3. Design computer simulations for dynamic systems, and
4. Communicate effectively the results of modeling studies orally and in writing.

## System simulation (labs)
General steps for building the simulation of system:
* Translate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) into a Matlab function;
* Evaluates the equations at any given point in time;
* Numerically integrate ordinary differential equations with Matlab's ode45;
* Create complete and legible plots of the resulting input, state, and output trajectories;
