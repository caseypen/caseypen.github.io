Teaching assistant of the course about the topic of the classic control theory. In the course, the basic principles governing the design and performance analysis of (analog) automatic feedback control system. It includes the use of Laplace transforms and block diagram representations to model the behavior of linear systems; their transient and steady-state behavior, and stability characteristics; and the use of root-locus and frequency-response methdologies design tool to guarentee desired performance charateristics. The use of these methods is illustrated by the development of MATLAB simulation programs as homework assignments.
